LIMITATIONS ON LEGAL ACTIONS A. All and any right you might have to damages, refunds, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the Terms and Conditions shall be extinguished unless you file an action within 1 month from the date of delivery of the shipment. B. All and any right that you might have to damages, refunds, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to our Terms and Condition shall be forfeited unless you first comply with all applicable notice periods and requirements in these terms and conditions. You and we understand that timely and complete compliance with such notice periods and requirements is a contractual condition precedent to your right to any relief whatsoever, and you must prove compliance with those conditions precedent on the face of any complaint that you file against us. You and we agree that Kxpress Logistics cannot be considered to have breached any obligation to you unless or until we wrongfully deny a claim submitted to us pursuant to the notice periods and requirements contained in these terms and conditions.

You agree that you will not sue us as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against us. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff. To the extent that any court finds that state rather than federal law applies to any provision of this contract, the controlling law is the substantive law of the state in which you tendered your shipment to us. The shipping of any packages does not make us an agent of the shipper or any third parties for any purposes. UNDELIVERABLE SHIPMENTS In the event a shipment is flagged “UNDELIVERABLE” shipment is one which cannot be delivered for numerous reasons herein listed and others not listed: • Non-payment for return shipment. • Recipient of a Hold at a Kxpress Logistics shipment cannot be located. • Recipient refuses to accept the shipment. • A Recipient’s delivery address cannot be located or is in-accurate. • Shipment was addressed to an area not served by Kxpress Logistics. • Damage to content or packaging of shipment to the point that rewrapping/repackaging is not possible. • The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property or injury to personnel. • Shipment contains prohibited items. • Recipient’s place of business is closed when delivery was attempted. • No appropriate person was available to accept the shipment at a delivery location on the initial delivery attempt or reattempts. • The shipment was improperly packaged. When practicable, we will contact the sender for instructions on returning or otherwise disposing of the shipment. If the sender requests return, (shipping will be charged to the sender). A. If a package shipment is undeliverable for any reason, we will attempt to notify the shipper to arrange for the shipment’s return. If a package is marked “Bill Recipient” and is refused or returned to the sender, the billing is automatically changed to “Bill Sender.” B. Package shipments will be returned via Kxpress Logistics Return Service at the shipper’s expense unless contrary instructions are received from the shipper/Merchant after five business days from the initial delivery attempt. However, non-freight package shipments will be returned at no additional charge if the shipment is undeliverable because of a service failure or damage to the shipment caused by Kxpress Logistics. If the shipment is undeliverable for any other reason, all return charges and fees will be assessed to the original shipper. C. Dangerous goods shipments will only be returned via Kxpress Logistics Dangerous Goods Service or other appropriate means. A dangerous goods special handling fee applies. The shipper must supply a completed return waybill and all other required documentation. D.
